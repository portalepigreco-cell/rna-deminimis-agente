Subject: Playwright Browser Not Found After Successful Build - Need Assistance

Dear Render Support Team,

I'm experiencing a persistent issue with Playwright on my Python web service deployed on Render. The browser executables are not found at runtime, despite the build completing successfully.

**ERROR MESSAGE:**
```
BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1187/chrome-linux/headless_shell
```

**CURRENT CONFIGURATION:**

Service Details:
- Service name: rna-deminimis-agente
- Plan: Standard
- Region: Frankfurt
- Runtime: Python 3.13
- Repository: https://github.com/portalepigreco-cell/rna-deminimis-agente

Build Command (in render.yaml):
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt && playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Start Command:
```yaml
startCommand: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --worker-class sync --timeout 300 wsgi:application
```

**WHAT I'VE TRIED:**

1. ✅ Using `playwright install chromium` (without --with-deps)
2. ✅ Using `playwright install --with-deps chromium`
3. ✅ Setting custom PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH environment variable
4. ✅ Using default Playwright browser path
5. ✅ Adding browser launch arguments: --no-sandbox, --disable-setuid-sandbox, --disable-dev-shm-usage
6. ✅ Using build.sh script vs inline build command
7. ✅ Multiple redeploys with cache clearing

**OBSERVATIONS:**

- The build logs show `playwright install` command executes
- No explicit errors during the build phase
- The error only appears at runtime when the application tries to launch the browser
- The path `/opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/` suggests Playwright is trying to use its default cache location

**QUESTIONS:**

1. Does Render's filesystem preserve files installed in `/opt/render/.cache/` between build and runtime?
2. Are there any known compatibility issues with Playwright on the Standard plan?
3. Should I switch to a Docker-based deployment for better Playwright compatibility?
4. Are there specific system dependencies missing that `--with-deps` doesn't install?
5. Can you check my build logs to see if the browsers are actually being downloaded during build?

**WHAT I NEED:**

I need to run Playwright/Chromium headless browser for web scraping as a core feature of my application. I'm willing to:
- Upgrade to a higher plan if needed
- Switch to Docker deployment if that's more reliable
- Modify the configuration as recommended by your team

Could you please:
1. Review my service's build logs to verify if browsers are being installed correctly
2. Advise on the recommended approach for Playwright on Render
3. Provide any Render-specific configuration examples for Playwright if available

**ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:**

This is a production application for calculating "De Minimis" state aid from Italian government databases (RNA.gov.it). The web scraping functionality is essential for the service.

I appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue. Please let me know if you need any additional information or access to my service logs.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,
Marco Cassani
